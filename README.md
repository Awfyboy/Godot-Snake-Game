# Godot-Snake-Game
 A small example about creating a simple snake game in Godot Engine.
 It teaches you how to:
 - create a player controller for real-time snake-like movement using tweens, 
 - make the snake grow, 
 - generate fruits in random positions,  
 - add logic for when the fruit spawns inside the snake,
 - play some basic sounds,
 - setup simple UIs for your game,
 - use basic string formatting for strings such as time,
 - create a basic game over screen
